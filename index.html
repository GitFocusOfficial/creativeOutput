        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>This project examines how social media, self-identity crises, and familial influence impact adolescent body image, leading to body dissatisfaction and related mental health issues. Proposed solutions include interactive workshops and an online resource hub aimed at promoting body positivity, media literacy, and self-acceptance among youth. These resources aim to empower individuals to navigate societal pressures effectively. Cited research emphasizes the importance of fostering positive self-concept in adolescents to mitigate long-term mental health risks (Mental Health Foundation, 2023; Royal Society for Public Health, 2017).</p>

    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Body image dissatisfaction is a growing concern for adolescents who face constant exposure to idealized body types on social media. This dissatisfaction can lead to mental health struggles, impacting self-esteem and long-term well-being. Addressing these issues is crucial, as adolescence is a formative period for identity and self-worth. Research from the Royal Society for Public Health highlights social media's influence on young people's body image, while the Mental Health Foundation points out its direct correlation with mental health outcomes (Royal Society for Public Health, 2017; Mental Health Foundation, 2023).</p>
